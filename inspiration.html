						<br><br>
						<p>This article aims to catalog common issues with the mechanic and implementation of Inspiration and provide tips and tricks on how to get better mileage out of the concept in your games. We will first define Inspiration, and how it is meant to flavor your game. We will then tackle common issues comparing the reality of how the mechanic should work vs. how it's most commonly experienced and follow-up with tips and tricks on how to get more mileage out of the concept.</p>

<h2>What is Inspiration?</h2>

<p>Inspiration is a rule the Dungeon Master can use to reward you for playing your character in a way that's true to his or her personality traits, ideal, bond, and flaw.</p>

<p>To players, mechanically, Inspiration is a token you spend to gain advantage on a roll, and that's all it is. You can only ever have one of these tokens in your possession, which is an incentive to use Inspiration up quick and not hoard it. You can also pass that token to others, so you might do that if you're about to get a second one.</p>

<p>Your DM can choose to give you Inspiration for a variety of reasons. Typically, DMs award it when you play out your personality traits, give in to the drawbacks presented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portray your character in a compelling way. Your DM will tell you how you can earn Inspiration in the game.</p>

<blockquote>Additionally, if you have Inspiration, you can reward another player for good role-playing, clever thinking, or simply doing something exciting in the game. When another player character does something that really contributes to the story in a fun and interesting way, you can give up your Inspiration to give that character inspiration.</blockquote>

<p>I view Inspiration as a chance to reshape the fates. We've all suffered terrible rolls at the worst possible opportunity, and I love the idea that because my character is heroic or villainous enough that I get the chance to try again.</p>

<blockquote>"Overall I really love the mechanic. I'm a big fan of meta-mechanics that let players have a bit more influence over the game without taking total control."</blockquote>

<h2>Common issues with Inspiration</h2>

<blockquote>I think inspiration is a good mechanic for rewarding outside the box thinking and good role-playing. Personally, I’m terrible at remembering to hand it out in the moment and in general, I believe DM’s don't give it out enough. It’s often hoarded by players because it's not distributed enough as we, the DM’s, put the barrier of earning it too high.</blockquote>
<span>Mike Corl </span>

<p>A consistent point of feedback is that the mechanic itself is great, but having the GM being the arbitrator of when a PC is "playing their character well" is just another thing on the pile of responsibilities the GM shoulders.</p>

<blockquote>I don't like being a judge of when characters gain it, as some players may be better at role-playing than others and put themselves in more situations where getting Inspiration makes sense.</blockquote>
								<span>Nicholas Qualls</span>

<p>The distinction of being more experienced or a better role-player can significantly affect the game table. Personally, I know working with a GM I've never played with before can make Inspiration a point of contention.</p> 

<blockquote>Using it as an incentive for role-playing is too vague. The PC and DM may have different interpretations of what "in character" should look like. Furthermore, if it's only rewarded for clever solutions or what have you, the opportunities to get it are too scarce.</blockquote>
								<span>Jonny Schultz</span>

<p>If you've ever sat at a table and been the only player not to get advantage because, for some reason, you aren't triggering this idea of what the GM considers to be "good role-playing", then you know this pain.</p>

<p>The book does give us guidance on when to award Inspiration to try and make it easier.</p>

<blockquote>I, as the GM, keep a list of everyone's traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. I refer to that list in play to make sure I award Inspiration appropriately. I feel a lot of GM's that forget about Inspiration don't do this step and just rely on their players to remember.</blockquote>
								<span>Sam Lyons</span>

<p>This statement is 100% valid and worthwhile. Sam also implements some other things in his games that we will speak on in the next section. My problem with keeping track of ideals, bonds, flaws, and all that is it requires your players to be good role-players. And I know that's the goal, but players are not always equal in their role-play ability. It's never been equal in any game I've ever played. You'll have players who love social engagement and others who want to be a part of a team. Some players will be purely reactive, so it may feel like a dig if they never get Inspiration. In contrast, the socially engaging and veteran players seem to get Inspiration every session. </p>

<h2>Your Mileage May Vary (Tips and Tricks)</h2>

<p>The name of the game is customization. You won't find these in the book, but my friends and I have been trying these out with much success, and I want to share our best practices. </p>

<blockquote>I house rule that players start with Inspiration (making it available immediately), and they can earn additional Inspiration through play. They always reset back to 1 at the start of the next session, though, so use it or lose. The only exception to that is if they do something to earn Inspiration right at the end of the session, so I might let them start with 2 points next session or something.</blockquote>
								<span>Sam Lyons</span>

<p>I love having players start with Inspiration because it feeds into the idea that you aren't just regular people. Players get the point of luck to try and succeed when the chips are down, and if they fail that second opportunity, well, then it really was not meant to be for that moment.  </p>

<blockquote>I've also used it when a character takes a grievous injury. I do that a lot in 5e, since magical healing is a thing. "Whoops, you lost your arm. Inspiration." or "That took out an eye. Inspiration." And then if they decide they want to keep a bad enough injury, we can even turn that into a flaw feat, but if not, they were compensated for the trouble and get it healed at a temple.</blockquote>
								<span>Tanner Eads</span>

<p>I love this one because magical healing is something else I've not experienced a lot in games! It gives your players an ideally short term problem they need to overcome but trading off with an extra advantage each session till they have it healed. </p>

<blockquote>I would alter it as well. I'm going to try treating it as 'reroll anyone die that your character can roll,' changing it from just the usual d20s to damage, effect, healing, etc.</blockquote>
								<span>Jonny Schultz</span>

<p>This idea has the potential to reshape your game significantly. If you have combat enthusiasts, you can get them into wanting to earn more Inspiration because they can boost their damage output or whatnot. Your players who are typically quiet during social scenes may engage more with such an incentive. </p>

<blockquote>I like it used as a reward for anyone who REALLY engages with the story and digs deep. If you ask an important question, if you engage with the lore, if you really sink in that emotion, that's the best, and I reward that. ...anyone who adds more to the game, in a way that drives engagement more than you'd expect? They deserve Inspiration.</blockquote>
								<span>Tanner Eads</span>

<p>Determine the energy you want at the table and let your players know so you can reward and encourage that kind of vibe. Do you want a light-hearted, fun game? Reward goofiness and players who are interacting with the world and its characters with optimism.</p>

<p>Inspiration gives agency to your players without breaking the framework of your story. They can be empowered to take bolder, riskier moves for the story's sake and their characters. </p>
