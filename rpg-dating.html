						<p>What follows is a system you can customize to your liking on how to introduce and progress relationships between player characters and NPCs. The goal of this guide is to provide a framework you can easily share with your players on how they may romance potential npcs without having to awkwardly flirt at the table.</p>


                           <p> The basis of the system starts with heart baubles</p>
                            
                            <p>Imagine 10 heart baubles that will progress your players romance with a potential npc. 1-3 is for early relationships, 4-6 for intermediate and strong relationships, 7-9 for deep, powerful love and the ultimate 10 being for marriage or some kind of commitment of the highest order.</p> 
                            
                            <p>Before we begin, you need to determine a few things about your NPC. </p> 
                            
                            <p>First: decide what their limitations are romantically. Are they straight, bi, gay, demi ect? Is there even a possibility of a romance based off of this information?</p> 
                            
                            <p>Second: what are their immediate likes? Are they into Centaurs? Do they like long dark hair?  Are they attracted to someone who has a reputation in the city? Come up with 3-4 likes for your NPC</p> 
                            
                            <p>Third: What are their dislikes? What things immediately turn them off? Do they dislike Dwarves? Did they have a bad experience with a wizard? Do muscles turn them off? Come up with 3-4 of these as well.</p> 
                            
                            <p>For the initial date the player needs to make a simple DC 15 Charisma roll to persuade the NPC to go on a date with them. Here is where the latter two choices you made come into play more heavily. They are meant to represent our own personal tastes. Most people have a type and your NPCs likes and dislikes will influence what the charisma roll dc turns out to be. For every like that a PC has, lower the DC by 2. For every dislike, increase the DC by +3</p> 
                            
                            <p>Example: Gabe wants to ask out the farm girl Elandra.Elandra’s likes are family oriented, horns (tieflings), long hair. Gabe works at his family’s tavern and has a good reputation in the town of being close with his family</p> 
                            
                            <p>Gabe’s charisma roll to get a date with Elandra would be 13. (Base 15 -2(family oriented))</p> 
                            
                            
                             <p>Now lets say Elandra had a dislike for adventurers. This changes the math quite a bit.</p> 
                            
                            <p>Date DC would be 16 (Base 15 -2 for family +3 because he is an adventurer)</p> 
                            
                           <p>Remember those heart baubles?</p> 
                            
                            <p>Every like your player has, they automatically get a heart filled.</p> 
                             
                            
                            <h3>Things your players can do to influence a chance at a date</h3> 
                            
                            <p>If your players express an interest in an NPC, you can come up with a simple request that the object of their desire be placed on a quest board. It can have varying degrees of complexity from wolves attacking my family’s farm to I lost an important item on this side of town and if you find it please return it to me.</p> 
                            
                            <p>These can be small quests that your PC can do that you can tie into major things you have planned. (or they can spend a free day searching the countryside looking for said items. When they do this favor for the person you can reward them on how that goes. It could be anything from giving advantage on the charisma roll because they see the PC in a positive light, giving them a bonus to the roll or having the NPC gain a new characteristic they find attractive and reduce the DC check. This all depends on how your players tackle it and what you think would work best.</p>
